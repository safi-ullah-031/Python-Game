# Air Hockey Game

## Project Overview

This project is a digital implementation of the classic air hockey game. I developed it in Python using the Tkinter library as part of my internship. It provides an interactive gaming experience in which players control paddles to hit a puck into the opponent's goal.

## Features

- Player-controlled paddles for both top and bottom players.
- Realistic puck movement with collision detection.
- Scoring mechanism and a graphical representation of an air hockey table.
- Graphical user interface created with Tkinter.
